Simply putting the code in a Cython file speeds it up by 36%:

```python
In [1]: import genfilt as c

In [2]: import genfilt_py as p

In [3]: import numpy as np

In [6]: image = np.random.rand(500, 500)

In [7]: %timeit out = c.maximum_filter(image)
1 loops, best of 3: 347 ms per loop

In [8]: %timeit out = p.maximum_filter(image)
1 loops, best of 3: 543 ms per loop
```
